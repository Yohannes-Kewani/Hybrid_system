    "**Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "Although Ethiopia is consistently expanding its national power generation capabilities, a significant disparity remains in electricity access, particularly among unserved communities. Statistical data reveals that approximately 80% to 85% of the Ethiopian population resides in rural hinterlands, where the infrastructure required for grid connectivity is currently nonexistent. Due to the dispersed settlement patterns of these rural homesteads, extending the national grid to reach them is not economically feasible in the short to medium term. To overcome this bottleneck in energy delivery, harnessing the country's abundant untapped renewable potentials—specifically wind and solar resources—is essential for resolving the energy crisis in rural communities and enhancing their socio-economic well-being.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this hybrid micro-grid design and performance analysis, the selected site is the rural vicinity of Mekelle City, located approximately 780 km north of the capital, Addis Ababa. The Mekelle area is well-identified for its high solar radiation intensity and significant wind energy potential. This potential is evidenced by the presence of the Ashegoda Wind Farm in the immediate vicinity. However, much like other large-scale projects, the Ashegoda station feeds its generated power directly into the National Grid (ICS), leaving the surrounding rural villages without access to the energy generated in their own backyard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to design and conduct a performance analysis of an isolated hybrid Micro-Grid power supply system using HOMER Pro. The aim is to deliver a reliable and cost-effective electric supply to a rural village near Mekelle. The proposed hybrid system integrates Wind Turbine Generators, Diesel Generators, and Solar PV panels. A distinct feature of this specific design analysis is the intentional exclusion of battery storage or other energy storage technologies. This strategy has been adopted to significantly minimize the system's Net Present Cost (NPC) and initial capital expenditure. The geographical location of the study area, as retrieved via the HOMER software mapping tool, is illustrated in Figure 1."

In addition to domestic consumption, the micro-grid is sized to support a significant agricultural load: two AC water pumps, each with a rated capacity of 100 kW, utilized for community irrigation.

    "**2 LITERATURE Review**\n",
    "\n",
    "Global electricity consumption continues to escalate, creating an urgent need for sustainable power solutions as fossil fuel reserves diminish. To mitigate reliance on conventional energy and address the inherent intermittency of standalone renewable technologies—such as solar photovoltaic (PV) or wind turbines—researchers increasingly advocate for hybrid off-grid systems. For instance, the design and performance analysis conducted for a rural village in the Adama area, Ethiopia [1], utilizes a hybrid approach to overcome resource variability, demonstrating the necessity of integrating multiple generation sources for reliable rural electrification.\n",
    "\n",
    "To effectively engineer these complex systems, the Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Energy Resources (HOMER) software serves as a critical tool. HOMER simplifies the evaluation of both off-grid and grid-connected configurations by modeling various inputs, including conventional generators, wind turbines, solar PV, hydropower, batteries, and biomass [2]. As highlighted in the methodology of [1], the software performs a rigorous economic analysis, calculating the total Net Present Cost (NPC), operational costs, and the Levelized Cost of Energy (COE) to identify the optimal system architecture [3]. Ultimately, these simulations support the development of robust micro-grids—localized power networks that aggregate distributed generation resources (DGR) ranging from solar arrays and wind converters to biodiesel generators and micro-turbines [4]."

    "**6. CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS**\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the HOMER Pro simulation results for the rural Mekelle site, it is concluded that a hybrid configuration integrating wind turbines, solar PV, and a diesel generator represents the most economically viable and technically reliable solution. This tri-hybrid architecture significantly outperforms standalone diesel generation or dual-source systems (Solar-Diesel or Wind-Diesel) in meeting the rigorous 250 kW peak demand of the village. The synergy between Mekelle’s highland wind patterns and high solar irradiance ensures a stable power supply, even in the absence of a battery storage system.\n",
    "\n",
    "A critical finding of this study is the significant volume of excess energy generated during peak production hours. Given that this design intentionally excludes storage to minimize capital costs, this surplus power presents a strategic opportunity. It can be utilized to accommodate the forecasted load growth over the next 10 to 15 years, as detailed in the village expansion projections in Table 1. Furthermore, this capacity margin provides a buffer for the anticipated increase in residential demand and potential future commercial activities within the community."
